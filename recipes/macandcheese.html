    <p><Em>During the end of the Great Depression, macaroni and cheese became a popular food item due to its low cost. It was billed as “the housewife's best friend, a nourishing one pot meal” and sold 8 million boxes when it was released by Kraft Foods in 1937. The popularity of the food then exploded once again in World War II.</Em></p>
